## Getting started with Next.js and Replicate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template project that's preconfigured to work with Replicate's API.

You can use this as a quick jumping-off point to build a web app using Replicate's API, or you can recreate this codebase from scratch by following the guide at [replicate.com/docs/get-started/nextjs](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nextjs)

## Noteworthy files

- [pages/index.js](pages/index.js) - The React frontend that renders the home page in the browser
- [pages/api/predictions/index.js](pages/api/predictions/index.js) - The backend API endpoint that calls Replicate's API to create a prediction
- [pages/api/predictions/[id].js](pages/api/predictions/[id].js) - The backend API endpoint that calls Replicate's API to get the prediction result

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```console
npm install
```

Add your [Replicate API token](https://replicate.com/account#token) to `.env.local`:

```
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your-token-here>
```

Run the development server:

```console
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

TODO
- the way we're doing message history isn't ideal, but that's complex and can be figured out later
- probably want some sort of logic to truncate the message history (so we're not sending a prompt that's too long — we don't want an error there)
- fix the runtime error
- auto-scrolldown on last message
- UI **touchups**
- System prompts
- add a select for the llama model (double check that they all have streaming)
